## Advent Of Code
In this repo I'll update my solutions to the yearly challenge of [**Advent Of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) by **Eric Wastl**.

## Project Structure
The solutions will be separated by year, day and language.

Example:
- 2020
  - d1
    - Python
      * day1.py
    - Rust
      - day1
    * input.txt
  - d2
    - Python
      * day2.py
    - Rust
      - day2
    * input.txt
